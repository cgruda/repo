#### About The Project

ZedBoard FPGA based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accelerator.

Final project for B.Sc. in EE at Tel Aviv Univerity, 2021. The project was submitted and will not be further developed.

The project was implemented using the following programs:

* []() Vivado HLS 2016.4
* []() Vivado HLx 2016.4
* []() Vivado SDK 2016.4

#### Repository structure:

* documents - work plan, midterm presentation, poster and project book
* hw_cnn - hls source and IP blocks and vivado design
* sw_cnn - software implementation
* simulation - simulation data and results

#### Usage

before runing any of the scripts its advised to go through the script comments and change
global path variables, as the scripts were written for a very specific setup.
